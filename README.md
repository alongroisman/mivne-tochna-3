In this project we tryed to simulate a robot arena.
in the robot arena the robots can communicate with each other and through this communication they can tell there whereabout.
we can tell with the if a robot is currently "recharging" or where exactly is there some kind of wall.

at the end of the process we transfer all the data to a notepad so we can track the movment of all the robots.
